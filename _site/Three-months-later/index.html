  <h1>My Journey - Day 133</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>100 days have passed since my last entry. A lot has happened.</p>

<p>I went off Keto because my leg swelled up and broke out, I was pretty worried. It did not get better so I went back on Keto but some test revealed my gall bladder (as I feared) was getting worse and my ALT’s in my liver were really high. So I went back to a clean eating approach.</p>

<p>Honestly, while I still think carbohydrate consumption (sugar I am looking at you) is the cause of most illness in my life and obesity. I am actually having more fun.</p>

<p>I have more energy, I am enjoying my life. I do not eat sugar unless it cannot be avoided (fruit for example). I will occasionally have a sauce that has a little sugar in it, but a little of something is better than my previous life.</p>

<p>I quit all soda even diet soda. No tea, I drink water. If I must have a flavor to my water I will use an electrolyte packet which has an artificial sweetener in it. These are terrible for me so I do them sparingly.</p>

<p>My diet consists of 6 days a week clean, 1 day a week I can eat what I want but I still try to stay at a reasonable caloric limit. I eat when I am hungry.</p>

<p>Essentially, I am eating the same diet that Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jay Cutler and many others eat. I eat clean during the week by that I mean:</p>

<p>Lean meats,
Complex Carbohydrates like rice, sweet potatoes, and vegetables.
I eat right now around 3000 kcalories a day. 
I now workout 6 days a week, and have a workout partner which has helped keep me accountable. 
When I started on clean eating I did take some numbers and I will post them for comparison below.</p>

<p>April 30th 2019 -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight: 391.6</li>
  <li>Height Inches: 75</li>
  <li>Neck Inches: 19</li>
  <li>Chest Inches: 55</li>
  <li>Bicep Inches: 16</li>
  <li>Forearm Inches: 15</li>
  <li>Wrist Inches: 8.5</li>
  <li>Stomach Inches: 57</li>
  <li>Hips Inches: 56</li>
  <li>Thigh Inches: 33</li>
  <li>Calf Inches: 20</li>
</ul>

<p>May 31st 2019 -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight: 375.6</li>
  <li>Height Inches: 75</li>
  <li>Neck Inches: 19</li>
  <li>Chest Inches: 53</li>
  <li>Bicep Inches: 15.5</li>
  <li>Forearm Inches: 13.5</li>
  <li>Wrist Inches: 8</li>
  <li>Stomach Inches: 60</li>
  <li>Hips Inches: 53</li>
  <li>Thigh Inches: 30</li>
  <li>Calf Inches: 20</li>
</ul>

<p>August 27 2019 -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight: 388 (it is not uncommon to gain weight after coming off Keto)</li>
  <li>Height Inches: 75</li>
  <li>Neck Inches: 19.5</li>
  <li>Chest Inches: 53.5</li>
  <li>Bicep Inches: 15.5</li>
  <li>Forearm Inches: 13.5</li>
  <li>Wrist Inches: 8</li>
  <li>Stomach Inches: 63</li>
  <li>Hips Inches: 54.5</li>
  <li>Thigh Inches: 32</li>
  <li>Calf Inches: 20</li>
</ul>

<p>So I gained some pounds and inches back but I am still lower than I was.</p>

<p>Sunday - Off</p>
<ul>
  <li>No workout, food cheat day</li>
</ul>

<p>So what exactly am I eating? I am glad you asked. I eat clean (mostly) I do eat some stuff that is not great like Sam’s choice aged bacon and cheddar burgers. They are a good protein source, they are grilled so MFP is not exactly right on the fat content most of that coooks off on the grill. I do not eat enough vegetables which I have a problem here, I like veggies but my girlfriend hates them. I bought some stir fry veggies for food prep this week and will be adding them in.</p>

<p>I am also doing regular food prep (thank you Walmart Grocery orders).</p>

<p>All in all a much healthier lifestyle and I think a maintainable one. The workouts are medium intensity until I get a few months under me then I can step it up to 4x12’s and swap out some movements.</p>

<p>If you want to know exactly what I eat? <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/CJSchrum">My food journal is public</a> if you visit and do not see food logged? Message me on MFP or IG and pester me to enter my food.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
