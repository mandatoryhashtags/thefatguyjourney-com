  <h1>Keto Journey - Day 3</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Well the first two days of Keto have passed and I am not feeling as crappy as I did. Monday was difficult I was lethargic all day. Tuesday was not as bad but I still just felt drained all day, with brain fog.</p>

<p>Today though I feel quite a bit better. A little tired of let’s call them, bathroom visits.</p>

<p>I have lost a lot of water weight the last few days, like 10 pounds of water has come off of me. So I look less puffy, it feels good to see 10 pounds come off the scale but I know its not real fat loss just water.</p>

<p>Still I was able to walk to the office this morning without feeling like I was going to die on the walk so that was amazing. I can tell this will be a difficult lifestyle to stick to, I am still having to lean heavily on the self discipline I have to not step out of the bounds of rules.</p>

<p>Everywhere I drive its 2 for 5 this or $1.49 nuggets that sound so tempting. It is hard to stick to the Keto diet in some ways because it is drastically inconvenient but I also feel like that is just an excuse.</p>

<p>I found out my landlord is a dietician, he agreed with my thoughts on going Keto so that made me feel better. The more I research, the more I read &amp; watch the more sense it makes. Am I under the spell of Gary Taubes and others? Possibly. Do I give a shit if I lose weight, feel better, and am there to walk my little girl down the aisle when she gets married in 20 years? No. I do not give two shits.</p>

<p>I am tired of the constant battle about diet. There is science to back up what I am doing. Better science that what Ansel Keyes had at least. Does the body builder, clean eating diet work? Damn right it does. I have done it. But, it does not work for me at least not right now. I need to lose two hundred or more pounds. To get to my goal weight of 180 I would have to lose 220 pounds that is what I weighed at 24. So take that into perspective I need to lose an entire large guy of weight.</p>

<p>The worst part is I need to do this quickly. The Doctor has already told me my liver is in bad shape, pretty soon my pancreas will give out. I am nearly 35 and I have been essentially treating my body like it is an amusement park for a long time.</p>

<p>I have done yo-yo dieting the last fea years. I would lose 50-70 pounds ger comfortable and then slide off the wagon. This blog is supposed to help with that. The letters to myself to remind me why I hate myself.</p>

<p>I know that sounds harsh but its time for truth. I am tired of pretending that I am okay. I’m not. Behind the confident bravado I have is a guy who literally hates himself. I talk about discipline but look at me. I cannot even stick to diet rules longer than three months. I have barely stuck to anything I have ever said I would do my whole life.</p>

<p>I have been fat most of my life. I remember having “man-boobs” when I was like 7. There was a time like at 14 I was in decent shape, then again in my late teens early twenties. When I left my first wife I got into pretty good shape, sadly thats because I was dating 18 year old girls at 23 and 24 years old so I kind of had to shape up.</p>

<p>Then somewhere around 2010-2012 working from home I started to gain weight. By 2014 I weighed 350. From 2014 to now I have yo-yo’d from a peak low of 300 to my peak high in April of 401 pounds. Long gone are the 2XL shirt days of 2008, long gone are the 42 inch pants. When I got down to 300 one of the joys I had was going to Wal-Mart and buying jeans off the rack. I cried in the changing room when they buttoned. Then … I just slowly fell apart.</p>

<p>My marriage started to tank. I took on a lot more stress. And, as usual stress is my eating green light. Pretty soon I was back up to 350, 360, 370. Then I tried the Gym and clean eating. I got down to 330 … then fell off the wagon. Then I shot up to 380 in April 2017.</p>

<p>I seem to go through these cycles where around April I start feeling like I need to lose weight and it lasts a few months then it goes away.</p>

<p>April 2017 I started Keto the first time, by the time I left my second wife I was down to like 330 in June. I could wear 3X’s in fact I still own shirts I bought myself on my 33rd birthday that are 3XL polo’s.</p>

<p>Then well … I just kind of took on one of the most stressful periods of my life over the last two years. Though I have tried to control it and diet during that time. Here we are.</p>

<p>This morning I weighed 385 pounds down from 401 April 1. I weighed 395 Sunday, I weighed 391 yesterday morning. I know its water weight but dammit its nice to feel like I can walk to the office without thinking I am going to die. If I cannot do it this time … Im not sure I will make it to Christmas this year.</p>

<p>The dark cloud of depression is starting to really brew over me, this journey is one of the few things that has pushed it back and make see sunshine again. No one knows it but me … but there was a time after my surgery where I didn’t care if I woke up the next day. I was not suicidal I just didn’t care.</p>
