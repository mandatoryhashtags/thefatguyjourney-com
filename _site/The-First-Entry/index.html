  <div class="entry">
    <p>A new journey must begin. Last summer I set out on a journey for weight loss it did not go well. It ended around the time I had my life overwhelmed by work, followed by surgery.</p>

<p>Many obese people like to make excuses for how the end up falling off the wagon, this is exactly what I did. I found excuses to fall off the wagon, and then my Appendix ruptured and due to complications during surgery I balooned to 400 pounds.</p>

<p>This is the heaviest I have ever been, and it is defeating. So I decided to start this blog for no one really but me. I want to record why I am losing weight as I go along.</p>

<p>I will also record what I am doing. This is no holds barred, I am even including images. At the start of April I weighed 401 pounds and I began the process of clean eating 6 days a week and 1 cheat day. I have not started working out yet like last time I wanted to drop some weight first.</p>

<p><img src="/images/progress/20190401-side.jpg" alt="What I look like now" /></p>

<p>Yeah, thats me. That was on April 1 and I wish it was an April Fools Day joke. I am big I know.</p>

<p>Sadly after speaking to a doctor I got devastating news. I do not have diabetes, I do not have overly high blood pressure, I do not have many issues except one. I have high liver enzymes.</p>

<p>During my surgery it was discovered I have lost between 30-50% of my liver function due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_liver_disease">Fatty Liver disease</a> this really was a gut check for me. It took me months to recover from surgery all the while I was gaining weight due to depression eating.</p>

<p>I have never hidden the fact that I have a very unhealthy relationship with food. I eat to celebrate a good day or happy event and I eat to lament a bad day or sad event. My addiction is everywhere, I blame no one but myself for the state I am in.</p>

<p>Yesterday I got three teeth pulled, my appendix ruptured in December and I am starting to feel like my body is breaking down. I can see the sun rising ahead of me and I am running to catch up. Pink Floyd really had something figured out with the song Time, as I age the song means more and more to me.</p>

<p>So what shall I do?</p>

<h3 id="keto-again">Keto Again</h3>

<p>So I am no stranger to Keto. I was on Keto for 4 months in 2017 and lost about fifty pounds, then my marriage collapsed due to a lot of reasons. I have dabbled with it since then but never been able to get going. The doctor wants me to lose 100 pounds or as close to it as I can get in 6 months which sounds very unhealthy. However, he is weighing it against the liklihood of death or liver failure. He prescribed Ketogenics more or less to get me there at least in the short term.</p>

<p>I went to a dietitian she said Keto was a bad idea as it is not sustainable. So I did it her way for a month, clean eating. Steped up my activity levels. I will have lost 6-8 pounds in the month come months end. Which is right on her target. The problem is in 6 months that is about 42 pounds which is pretty below what the doctor asked for.</p>

<p>So now I am facing month 2, I am losing sleep at night thinking about my little girl growing up without a dad. It is time for insane, it is time to extreme. This is the time to do whatever I can because if I don’t I may not see a years progress. If Keto does not work I am looking at a gastric surgery which I do not want as the risk are too great.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>I figured out what I needed for motivation. Just some notes to myself … I will include them here in the blog. I plan on hiding nothing during this journey.</p>

<h3 id="letter-to-me-04-23-2019">Letter to me 04-23-2019</h3>

<p>Hey Me,</p>

<p>Its April 23rd your 395ish pounds. You just had three teeth pulled, setup your monitor and decided to do this blog. You might forget along the way why you are losing weight so I am here to remind you why.</p>

<ol>
  <li>You can barely walk to work from the car, your heart rate gets to 122-130 on the short walk</li>
  <li>You cannot take the stairs</li>
  <li>None of your clothes fit</li>
  <li>You bought new jeans and essentially blew them out</li>
  <li>You cannot walk through the store without needing benches</li>
  <li>Your knees hurt if you stand too long</li>
  <li>You have a flight next month and you are terrified of being too large to fly</li>
  <li>You don’t want your mom to bury her son and it worries you</li>
  <li>You don’t want your daughter or your son to grow up without you</li>
  <li>You finally are getting to a point in life where stress is so much lower than it was</li>
</ol>

<p>Those my friend are ten of the reasons you are forcing yourself to lose weight. Don’t let me down, I am counting on you to come through for me, I need to you stick with this. No matter how bad you want to quit, no matter how hard it is, how tired you are from the diet you do not want to be back here again. You are going to die. Let’s do this.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>You</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h3>

<p>It is time to wrap this up for tonight. I plan to update this regulary. Keto starts May 1st. If I am not updating it after May someone who reads this should ping me on Instagram, or another social platform and ask me why I am not doing so.</p>
