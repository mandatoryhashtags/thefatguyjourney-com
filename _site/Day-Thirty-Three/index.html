  <h1>Keto Journey - Day 33</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>A month has passed. I did my 1 month weigh in today.</p>

<p>There is a weird quirk in the data but it is done.</p>

<p>April 30th 2019 -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight: 391.6</li>
  <li>Height Inches: 75</li>
  <li>Neck Inches: 19</li>
  <li>Chest Inches: 55</li>
  <li>Bicep Inches: 16</li>
  <li>Forearm Inches: 15</li>
  <li>Wrist Inches: 8.5</li>
  <li>Stomach Inches: 57</li>
  <li>Hips Inches: 56</li>
  <li>Thigh Inches: 33</li>
  <li>Calf Inches: 20</li>
</ul>

<p>May 31st 2019 -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weight: 375.6</li>
  <li>Height Inches: 75</li>
  <li>Neck Inches: 19</li>
  <li>Chest Inches: 53</li>
  <li>Bicep Inches: 15.5</li>
  <li>Forearm Inches: 13.5</li>
  <li>Wrist Inches: 8</li>
  <li>Stomach Inches: 60</li>
  <li>Hips Inches: 53</li>
  <li>Thigh Inches: 30</li>
  <li>Calf Inches: 20</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall great losses. Weird quirk in that my stomach gained 3 inches when I feel smaller but data is data.</p>

<p>I lost 16 pounds in May including traveling to Las Vegas for 4 days for work. I lost April 1 - April 30 on clean eating only 10 pounds. So 23% of the weight I have lost since April is due entirely to Keto.</p>

<p>It is more than that though, I do feel better. However, financially this has been very expensive. I have nearly doubled the food budget doing Keto. This seems inevitable.</p>

<p>Still I like the new lifestyle, the cravings are pretty much gone. I do not go hungry which is nice. I have not walked into a Gym yet and am losing weight at a nice steady pace. My clothes are getting more loose which is nice.</p>

<p>A lot of this has been helped by DietDoctor.com</p>

<p>A pair of jean shorts I could not wear in April fit me again which was a great confidence builder. Clothes I bought for my work trip are getting baggy which is nice.</p>

<p>More importantly the back pain is virtually gone. I can walk to and from my car with no issues, walk around WalMart with no issues. Lethargy is still a problem some days as is brain fog so I have definitely not achieved some Zen state of mental clarity that is talked about.</p>

<p>Overall, I am pleased with Keto and the lifestyle. I am becoming a ketovangelist. I have not been blogging as much as I wanted to but I am just busy.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
