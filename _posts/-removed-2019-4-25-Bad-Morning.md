Warning language within:

They say a support system is the most important part of weightloss, along with healthy diet. I have long knew that diet is more important than exercise because you will never outwork a bad diet. I admit, I have always considered the support system not that important. This morning it finally hit how important it really is.

While I have always had issues with self image, I have also always been a confident male. I have a ENTJ personality type. I have always been confident that while I may not look the best I was good where it mattered. I was affectionate, intelligent and a good lover.

This morning I learned that apparently my weightgain has affected part of that. I learned I am no longer as good of a lover as I once was. I guess arrogance made me think I could continue to be, but I made the mistake of trusting my significant other to be able to be honest with me. 

Its a private matter so Im not willing to go into very deep specifics on a public blog but needless to say I had been getting the feeling this was the case. I stepped up, I tried to be better, to be more, but it has clearly failed. I am so tired of fighting to keep this going, trying to keep them interested, worrying if they are faithful, trying to keep from saying the wrong thing or doing the wrong thing. 

Just when I think I am getting myself sorted out it seems like something else comes along and derails me. I get the support structure now, it is supposed to encourage you to keep going. My support structure makes me want to say fuck it. 

I have told people along in the past that they should and must have a strong "Why" if your "Why" is not strong enough you will fail. I have tried to use many "Whys" over the years. Now I feel like my "Why" is just to spite my SO. 

I do not begrudge them for losing interest or being less attracted to me, I weigh 400 pounds. I get that. I take umbridge with the fact they are unwilling to communicate with me about it, they pretend everything is fine and act like I am a lunatic when I suggest otherwise. So now I find myself wanting to just leap hard into Keto, for as long as I can out of spite. Let rage and anger drive me to success. I have always said the Sith had that "Force" shit figured out.


### What now

Well I am drinking a Keto coffee from Wal Mart. They sell K-Cups for Keto now. I have never used them and wanted to try them so far not bad. Im eating some pepperoni with it, no carbs in this. I figure what the hell, who cares about sorting myself out or making sure I have everything I need to counter the keto flu. Obviously, I am not that reckless I will goto the store tonight and get some staples such as bone broth to help me through the next few days. 

Like Jocko says why do tomorrow what you could kick ass doing today. Alright so to be fair I have no knowledge of him saying that but it sounds like something he would say.

### Motivation

1. Read Discipline Equals Freedom
2. Watch some science on Keto
3. Remember my rage


### No letter

I don't need a letter every installment just one a month I think.



### Wrap up

I will post again tomorrow if I remember.
