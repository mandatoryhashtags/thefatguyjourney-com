So Keto is going okay so far. No numbers to report yet, but I am enjoying it. I had to have slightly more carbs last night than the 20 I usually consume because cravings were killing me. I went with a sugar-free pudding made with heavy cream. I ended up eating about 12-14g carbs there plus about 10-15 during the day. So I went over 20 by 9ish carbs at the upper end. 

## COVID-19
So the dreaded virus has come to Springfield. People are kind of panicked; I have not been. But, it seems people have confused a quarantine from social distancing.

Currently, my house I am forcing social distancing. We are limiting our trips out, not eating out if it can be avoided, ordering our groceries online, I am working from home. The most significant impact is on my GF (mesome). She has a bit more social life, okay she has a social life, and I do not. 

No one is handling this well. I miss going into the office to work. 

But, this is not a quarantine. This is social distancing. 

A quarantine means we cannot leave the house except for emergencies. Places like Spain and Italy have broad quarantines today. Social distancing is inconvenient; a quarantine is painful. 

Under social distancing, if we want to get out for a bit and walk around a bit, we can. Pokemon Go walks or just getting some sunlight; we can do those things as long as we avoid other people and keep about 6ft-10ft apart from anyone we pass and as long as we are asymptomatic. Under quarantine, we cannot. To me, this is a massive difference to others; it may not be.

What I am not doing so far is letting this be an excuse to break regimen. And I could easily use it as a crutch to do so.

Stay safe, everyone.

The journey continues.
