A month has passed. I did my 1 month weigh in today.

There is a weird quirk in the data but it is done.

April 30th 2019 - 
* Weight: 391.6
* Height Inches: 75
* Neck Inches: 19
* Chest Inches: 55
* Bicep Inches: 16
* Forearm Inches: 15
* Wrist Inches: 8.5
* Stomach Inches: 57
* Hips Inches: 56
* Thigh Inches: 33
* Calf Inches: 20

May 31st 2019 - 
* Weight: 375.6
* Height Inches: 75
* Neck Inches: 19
* Chest Inches: 53 
* Bicep Inches: 15.5
* Forearm Inches: 13.5
* Wrist Inches: 8
* Stomach Inches: 60
* Hips Inches: 53
* Thigh Inches: 30
* Calf Inches: 20

Overall great losses. Weird quirk in that my stomach gained 3 inches when I feel smaller but data is data.

I lost 16 pounds in May including traveling to Las Vegas for 4 days for work. I lost April 1 - April 30 on clean eating only 10 pounds. So 23% of the weight I have lost since April is due entirely to Keto.

It is more than that though, I do feel better. However, financially this has been very expensive. I have nearly doubled the food budget doing Keto. This seems inevitable.

Still I like the new lifestyle, the cravings are pretty much gone. I do not go hungry which is nice. I have not walked into a Gym yet and am losing weight at a nice steady pace. My clothes are getting more loose which is nice.

A lot of this has been helped by DietDoctor.com

A pair of jean shorts I could not wear in April fit me again which was a great confidence builder. Clothes I bought for my work trip are getting baggy which is nice. 

More importantly the back pain is virtually gone. I can walk to and from my car with no issues, walk around WalMart with no issues. Lethargy is still a problem some days as is brain fog so I have definitely not achieved some Zen state of mental clarity that is talked about. 

Overall, I am pleased with Keto and the lifestyle. I am becoming a ketovangelist. I have not been blogging as much as I wanted to but I am just busy.

Thanks for reading.
