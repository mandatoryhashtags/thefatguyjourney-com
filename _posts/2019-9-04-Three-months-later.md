100 days have passed since my last entry. A lot has happened. 

I went off Keto because my leg swelled up and broke out, I was pretty worried. It did not get better so I went back on Keto but some test revealed my gall bladder (as I feared) was getting worse and my ALT's in my liver were really high. So I went back to a clean eating approach.

Honestly, while I still think carbohydrate consumption (sugar I am looking at you) is the cause of most illness in my life and obesity. I am actually having more fun. 

I have more energy, I am enjoying my life. I do not eat sugar unless it cannot be avoided (fruit for example). I will occasionally have a sauce that has a little sugar in it, but a little of something is better than my previous life.

I quit all soda even diet soda. No tea, I drink water. If I must have a flavor to my water I will use an electrolyte packet which has an artificial sweetener in it. These are terrible for me so I do them sparingly.

My diet consists of 6 days a week clean, 1 day a week I can eat what I want but I still try to stay at a reasonable caloric limit. I eat when I am hungry.

Essentially, I am eating the same diet that Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jay Cutler and many others eat. I eat clean during the week by that I mean:

Lean meats,
Complex Carbohydrates like rice, sweet potatoes, and vegetables.
I eat right now around 3000 kcalories a day. 
I now workout 6 days a week, and have a workout partner which has helped keep me accountable. 
When I started on clean eating I did take some numbers and I will post them for comparison below.


April 30th 2019 - 
* Weight: 391.6
* Height Inches: 75
* Neck Inches: 19
* Chest Inches: 55
* Bicep Inches: 16
* Forearm Inches: 15

August 27 2019 - 
* Weight: 388 (it is not uncommon to gain weight after coming off Keto)
* Height Inches: 75
* Neck Inches: 19.5

So what exactly am I eating? I am glad you asked. I eat clean (mostly) I do eat some stuff that is not great like Sam's choice aged bacon and cheddar burgers. They are a good protein source, they are grilled so MFP is not exactly right on the fat content most of that coooks off on the grill. I do not eat enough vegetables which I have a problem here, I like veggies but my girlfriend hates them. I bought some stir fry veggies for food prep this week and will be adding them in.

I am also doing regular food prep (thank you Walmart Grocery orders). 

All in all a much healthier lifestyle and I think a maintainable one. The workouts are medium intensity until I get a few months under me then I can step it up to 4x12's and swap out some movements. 

If you want to know exactly what I eat? [My food journal is public](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/CJSchrum) if you visit and do not see food logged? Message me on MFP or IG and pester me to enter my food.

Thank you for reading!
