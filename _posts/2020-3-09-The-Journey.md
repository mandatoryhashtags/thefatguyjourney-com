A new journey must begin. 

It is a year later and surprise I am exactly the same place I was last year.
I cannot hide from the fact that a year ago in April I wanted to lose weight and was around 400 pounds. Well I am currently 400 pounds and I did lose weight, quite a bit. 

Looking back at all the crazy diets I did last year ... only one worked.

I have a mountain of excuses about why I never stick with it but if I am being honest (otherwise why write this?) I like food.

I love food.

When things are good, I eat to celebrate.
When things are bad I eat to feel better.

I had a drinking problem in 2008 and I pulled back from the edge ... I replaced one addicition with another. Now I have a super drama filled household that can explode at a moments notice and when it does I find comfort in mexican food or chinese food. Neither are healthy.

This time around it is just me going on the regimen. I think that is better for me. I can force myself to do things that others are uncomfortable with. (I did two months vegan November and December last year).

### Keto Again

So I am no stranger to Keto. I was on Keto for 4 months in 2017 and lost about fifty pounds, then my marriage collapsed due to a lot of reasons. I have dabbled with it since then but never been able to get going. I went keto last year and lost a sizable amount of weight.

I then went off keto for some pretty bullshit reasons (which never got better by the way). 

Let's do it right this time.
